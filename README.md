# Revitalizing-Revenue-Strategies-Insights-for-the-Hospitality-Industry

About the Project: AtliQ Grands, a leading player in hospitality, confronted declining market share and revenue due to heightened competition and subpar management choices. To combat these challenges, they aimed to harness Business and Data Intelligence.

Problem Statement: To regain market share through strategic analysis.

And leveraging my expertise, I have crafted an interactive dashboard that includes KPIs like cancellation rate, occupancy %, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR).

Insights & Recommendations: Outlined in my presentation (AtliQgrands_Presentation.mp4) which aimed to optimize revenue streams, enhance customer experience, and strengthen market positioning.

I have done all the above analysis using SQL queries also.
